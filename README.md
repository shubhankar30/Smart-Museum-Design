The current localization techniques heavily depend upon theGlobal Positioning System (GPS)technology. However, this technology has its limits in indoor locations. In
places like malls and underground parkingâ€™s, the GPS accuracy is greatly affected. Indoor localization requires higher accuracy and thus the use of GPS is not feasible in
such scenarios. Smartphones contain multiple sensors and hardware such as GPS receivers, accelerometers, and gyroscope sensors. Moreover almost all the smartphones are
equipped with Bluetooth and IEEE 802.11 connectivity. This paper explores the possibility of using the IEEE 802.11 signal strength and the Bluetooth signal strength combined with the
smartphone sensors of the accelerometer to determine indoor location of the user.In this project, an indoor localization technique is proposed, for a scenario in a museum
environment. Moreover after estimating the position, context based information will be provided to the user.
